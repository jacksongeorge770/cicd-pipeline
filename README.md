# CI/CD Pipeline Deployment to AWS EC2 Using GitHub Actions
Welcome to my personal project repository, where I demonstrate how I automate the deployment of backend services using GitHub Actions, Docker, and AWS EC2. This project showcases my ability to set up CI/CD pipelines, containerize applications, and deploy them to the cloud ‚Äî reflecting my skills and experience in modern development workflows.


## üõ†Ô∏è Deployment Steps

### 1. CI Pipeline (GitHub Actions)
Created CI pipeleine.


Logs into DockerHub using credentials stored in GitHub Secrets:
- DOCKER_USERNAME
- DOCKER_PASSWORD
Push code to the main branch triggers the CI pipeline.
Builds a Docker image using the provided Dockerfile.
Tags and pushes the image to DockerHub repository: jackson216/cicd-pipeline.

### 2. CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions on EC2)

- GitHub self-hosted runner runs on AWS EC2.
- When CI completes:
  - Pulls latest Docker image from DockerHub.
  - Stops and removes old container (if exists).
  - Runs the updated container exposing port 8080

### 3. EC2

- EC2 Ubuntu 24.04 instance is used.
- Security group allows HTTP (port 80) ,HTTPS(443) SSH (22)
- Validate with:
  ```bash
  curl http://<your-ec2-ip>
